The course explores book selection, vocabulary development, inferential reasoning, the use of repeated readings, responding to students' questions and confusions, and crafting high-cognitive demand discussions in narratives read aloud to children from Pre-K through fourth grade. The roles of adults and approaches to sharing books with children are explored from developmental and cultural perspectives. Content includes careful study and discussion of narrative picture books, criteria for identifying high-quality literature, and extracting worthy story themes with an aim toward developing skill in using books that embody humanizing pedagogies and diverse perspectives. Assignments involve the application of course content to teacher observations, the implementation of multiple readings in embedded fieldwork experiences, book studies, and the opportunities for special projects related to nuanced interest areas.

As climate change advances, our relationship to nature is more complex than ever before. On the one hand, societies have an unprecedented capacity to reconfigure the environment through processes that range from genetic manipulation to geo-engineering. On the other hand, the unequal distribution of environmental problems across races, classes, genders, and nations is intensifying and demands critical interrogation. From farmer suicides in India to protests over hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\") and oil pipelines in North America, social movements are demanding more democratic control over land and natural resources. In this course, we will explore environmental justice in theory and practice. Drawing on geography, anthropology, history, and critical race studies, we will examine the following questions: What is nature? Who defines and controls it? Why do environmental inequalities arise and how are they maintained? How are groups resisting and organizing around environmental and climate justice concerns? [3]",

Yet much leadership research has typically addressed leadership development from a traditional view: white, male, positional leadership. How can we bring about a shift in the view of leaders and leadership? What role does and can gender identity play in effective approaches to leadership? In what ways can we learn to problematize situations and develop solutions through more contemporary leadership approaches? Utilizing research, popular readings, and voices from leaders from various gender identities, this course will examine the theoretical perspectives of leadership and gender.  Exploration of one\u2019s view of self-as-leader including gender identity, will also be incorporated.  Students will come to understand what we know about gender and leadership through the examination and critique of the scholarship, and learn how to use their own voice to be an advocate for self and others.

The flexible methodology of LDP accommodates personalized, individual development at all levels of proficiency throughout the officer educational experience, from program entry to commissioning. The LDP includes basic leadership training, periodic assessment and counseling at both team and individual levels by experience observers. Trends and deficiencies are identified and addressed with retraining and reassessment in a continuous cycle. Effective leader development is progressive, building on lessons learned and maximizing individual potential. This course introduces students to the leadership development process by providing structured leadership opportunities in a variety of training settings. Student performance in leadership roles is assessed and notable strengths and weaknesses are identified. A plan for improvement is discussed in detail during one-on-one counseling sessions. [1]",

        "description": "Mass Incarceration is one of the most serious legal and social issues in the United States today. Our excessive rate of imprisonment, exacerbated by equivalently high rates of probation, makes us an extreme outlier among democratic nations. Mass incarceration affects nearly all groups in our society, but disproportionately impacts racial minorities, wreaking havoc on the lives of individuals, their families and their communities. This course is an inquiry into the causes and effects of this strange and destructive policy. It\u2019s divided into six units. The first explores the idea of punishment and the use of incarceration as a mode of punishment, relying on a wide variety of sources that include philosophy, religion, history, sociology and literature, and delineating the basic types of arguments that these sources deploy. The second unit provides a description of the nature and effect of mass incarceration as it exists at present, based on observers\u2019 accounts, first person narratives by prisoners, and documentary films. The third unit discusses the prisoners\u2019 rights litigation of the 1960s through 80s, and its impact on prison conditions and prison populations. The fourth considers various explanations that have been advanced to explain mass incarceration in the U.S., including racism, classism, political manipulation, mass media and voter preferences. In the final unit, alternatives to imprisonment will be assessed, including electronic monitoring, restorative justice and prison abolition. The course requirements are participation in the seminar discussions and one paper at the end that will give you a chance to state your own views about the subject matter.

Those systems also frequently fall short, both reflecting and exacerbating racial disparities. Students will learn to understand and critique concepts such as the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline,\u201d as well as the societal choice to treat some children as legal adults subject to serious criminal sentences such as life without parole.

We explore the relationship between science and culture and look at how the physical shape of instruments influences art (and how art shapes instruments). Throughout the course, we are guided by creativity and innovation by drawing upon musical repertoire and instrumental performance practices. Enrolled students will be selected randomly from the wait list after they have demonstrated minimum qualifications via a short quiz.  Students must have a basic understanding in both music and math. On the music side, a comfort with basic music note reading and the elements of Western music (intervals, scales, rhythms). On the math side, comfort with precalculus, including basic trig, logs, and exponentials. [3]",

But EDA is actually a whole philosophy of data analysis, and includes treatment of ethics and propriety in research. In this class we study EDA, as it has developed over the past four decades. We also do a great deal of EDA. An \"EDA Portfolio\" is developed by each student of different data analysis and graphical analysis projects. Included within the course is treatment of \"big data\" and data mining approaches, and also discussion of the current \"replication crisis\" and its emphasis on Questionable Research Practices (QRP's); EDA provides a certain type of prescriptive treatment of QRP's.
